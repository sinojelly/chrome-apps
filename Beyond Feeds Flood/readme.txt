This is a Chrome extension google reader client.

It supports notify the unread count of feeds in Important label(You must create a label Important in Google Reader) or whole reading-list, The badge background color is different, important is red, but reading-list is green.
Treat Important label specially is very important, you never lost important feeds now.

And you can read feeds in the popup windows very quickly, ether Important or whole reading-list. when going to older page, the items in current page are marked as read.
Also, you can star any item you like.

Compare to Notifier for Google Reader, I added supporting important label, auto mark items as read, detail info tooltip, icon of source, etc.

First, i just want to write it for personal use. When i completed it, i found it maybe usefull for every Google Reader User, so i published it. Thanks to Jan Potoms again！
